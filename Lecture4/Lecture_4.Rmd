##Sample data

- For learning and testing purposes, R base and its packages provide several data sets.

- If you want to load a specified data set, type `data("name of the dataset")`

##Example:

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(nycflights13)

data("flights")

```

Ps: If you do not have the package already installed, please do it before loading the library.

#Tibbles

class: middle

##Tibbles

- Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviours to make life a little easier. 

- Most other R packages use regular data frames, however we can coerce a data frame to a tibble using `as_tibble()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

data(iris)

as_tibble(iris)

```


---

##Tibbles - Iris data

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

data(iris)

as_tibble(iris)

```

---
## Tibbles

We can create a new tibble from individual vectors with `tibble()`


```{r}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

---

##Tibbles versus data.frame

- Tibbles never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!)

- Tibbles never changes the names of variables, and it never creates row names.

- Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. 

- We can use `print()` to control the number of rows `(n)` and the width of the display. Using `width = Inf` will display all columns:

```{r}
print(as_tibble(iris), n = 2, width=Inf)
```

---

##Subsetting


```{r}
df = tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)

# Extract by name
df$x

df[["x"]]

# Extract by position
df[[1]]


```

##ggplot 2


- R has several systems for making graphs, but ggplot2 is one of the most elegant and most versatile. 
-  ggplot2 implements the **grammar of graphics** a coherent system for describing and building graphs.
- Further details about the **grammar of graphics** can be found at [The Layered Grammar of Graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf.) 

_ Here we will learn by examples.

##Example: mpg data set

.pull-left[

- Let’s use our first graph to answer a question: 
- Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? 
- What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?
]

##Example: mpg data set

- `mpg` data frame found in `ggplot2` is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows).

- `mpg` contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

Among the variables in mpg are:

- `displ`, a car’s engine size, in litres.

- `hwy`, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).

A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

---
##How to answer the question ?

- We cannot answer the question only observing the raw data because there a lot of observations and variables.

- We need to summarize the information and, one alternative is to use data visualization.

- For this particular case, we have two numerical variables car’s engine size and fuel efficiency.

- Therefore, an alternative is to make a scatter plot.

## Scatter plot

- A scatter plot is a type of data display that shows the relationship between two numerical variables. 

-  A scatter plot  is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. 


---
###Creating a scatter plot using ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


---
class: middle

###Interpretation of the plot

- The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency (hwy). 

- In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. 

- Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?

---
##Some details

- We began a plot with the function `ggplot()`.

- `ggplot()` creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to.

- The first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph. 

- Therefore `ggplot(data = mpg)` creates an empty graph.


---

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

---
##Some details

- We can complete our graph by adding one or more layers to `ggplot()`. 

- The function  `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to our plot, which creates a scatterplot. 

- `ggplot2` comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. 

- Each geom function in `ggplot2` takes a mapping argument. 

- This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. 

- The mapping argument is always paired with `aes()`, and the x and y arguments of `aes()` specify which variables to map to the x and y axes.

- `ggplot2` looks for the mapped variables in the data argument, in this case, mpg.

##Reusable templat


To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

###Exercises

a. Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?

b. How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?

c.  What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.

d. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

e.  What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?
